# âš¡ Load Forecasting using XGBoost

This project focuses on forecasting electrical load using **XGBoost**, a high-performance gradient boosting algorithm. It leverages historical time series data from transformer lines to predict short-term load demand with high accuracy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Forecasting Objective

The model aims to forecast load values for the following transformer lines and aggregated metrics:

- **kVA - 132 L3**
- **kVA - 132 L5**
- **kVA - 33**
- **Total kVA**

These forecasts help in optimizing load planning, enhancing energy efficiency, and ensuring supply-demand balance in real-world power systems.
